## Game Logic:
- Turn on your Tamago Watch
- Your Tamago Watch pet will come to life on screen.
- See the current time on your clock.
- The following metrics are displayed for your pet: 
    - Food (1-10 scale)
    - Sleep (1-10 scale)
    - Fun (1-10 scale)
- The buttons are to feed your pet, turn off the lights and play with your pet.
- Name your pet whatever you wish!
- Be immersed in the retro future!
- Your pet will grow!
- Your pet will die if Food, Sleep or Fun hits 0!
- Your pet will morph at certain ages.
- Your pet will animate across the screen while it's alive.

## Explanation of Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Jquery

## Approach Taken:
A few articles and a few buttons in HTML controlled by JavaScript DOM manipulation. Most of the magic happens in 
Javascript, where I have classes for your pet, the watch itself and timing.
