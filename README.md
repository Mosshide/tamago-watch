## Game Logic:
- Turn on your Tamago Watch

- The following metrics are displayed for your pet: 
    - Food (1-10 scale)
    - Sleep (1-10 scale)
    - Fun (1-10 scale)
    - Age
- The buttons are to feed your pet, turn off the lights and play with your pet.
- Name your pet whatever you wish!
- Be immersed in the retro future!
- Your pet will grow!
- Your pet will die if Food, Sleep or Fun hits 0!
- Your pet will morph at certain ages.
